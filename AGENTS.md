## 1. What this project is

This repo extends the official artifact for the MICRO 2025 paper
**"Understanding and Mitigating Covert and Side Channel Vulnerabilities
Introduced by RowHammer Defenses"** (Bostancı et al., ETH Zürich /
[arXiv:2503.17891](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17891)). The paper introduces
**LeakyHammer**, a class of attacks that turn DRAM RowHammer *defenses* into
timing covert channels and side channels.

We have:

1. The original LeakyHammer artifact (gem5 + Ramulator2, two RowHammer
   defenses: PRAC and RFM, plus a website-fingerprinting side channel).
2. **A new defense, DREAM-C, that we ported in from a separate paper
   (`DREAM.pdf` in the repo root) and integrated into the same
   evaluation harness.**

The point of the work is to evaluate whether DREAM-C — a more recent,
counter-based RowHammer mitigation — is more or less leaky than the
industry-standard PRAC/RFM defenses, using the LeakyHammer methodology.

### 1.1 The LeakyHammer paper in one paragraph

RowHammer is a DRAM bug where repeatedly activating a row causes bit flips
in nearby rows. Defenses like **PRAC** (Per-Row Activation Counting) and
**RFM** (Refresh Management) prevent flips by issuing extra refresh commands
when a row gets hit too often. These extra refreshes block memory accesses,
making them slower. LeakyHammer's insight: a **sender** process can
deliberately hammer a row to trigger one of these refreshes, and a
**receiver** process on the same machine can detect the resulting latency
spike. Sender and receiver both run on a simulated multi-core gem5 system
sharing one DRAM. Send a `1` by hammering, send a `0` by sleeping; receiver
probes a few rows every ~µs and decodes bits from the latency it sees. The
paper measures channel capacity (Kbps) at various noise levels.

### 1.2 The three defenses in this repo

| Preset | Source | What it does | Status in our repo |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------------------|
| **PRAC** | LeakyHammer artifact | Tracks per-row ACT count; triggers a "back-off" refresh once a counter saturates | Untouched original |
| **RFM**  | LeakyHammer artifact | Memory controller issues periodic RFM commands proportional to recent ACT count | Receiver patched (drift fix, see §6) |
| **DREAM-C** | Ported from `DREAM.pdf` | Counts ACTs at *gang* (group of rows that map to one shared counter via random per-bank XOR mask) granularity; issues `DRFMab` (Directed Refresh Management, all banks) when a gang counter saturates | New addition: Ramulator plugin + new sender/receiver binaries + receiver patched. **Plugin rewritten 2026-04-25; harness address-mapping fixed 2026-04-26 — see §5.1 + §5.1.2 changelog.** Empirical result: ≤ 0.15 Kbps capacity under noise (§6). |

DREAM-C uses the JEDEC-standard DRFMab command path that already existed in
the Ramulator2 DDR5-VRR model.

## 3. The experiment matrix

`gem5/result-scripts/run_config.py` defines what runs. Current settings:

```python
PERSONAL_RUN_THREADS = 4              # parallel docker containers (DON'T crank past 4 — OOM risk)
MSG_BYTES = 100                       # 800 bits per message
DATA_PATTERNS = ["0x00", "0x55", "0xAA", "0xFF"]  # alternating + constant bit patterns
```

Per-preset parameters (in the `get_preset_variables()` function):

| Preset | TXN_PERIOD (ns) | Sender binary  | Receiver binary  | Noise rates (ACTs/window) |
|--------|-----------------|----------------|------------------|----------------------------|
| PRAC   | 25 000          | `prac_sender`  | `prac_receiver`  | `[275, 475, 1075, 1975]`   |
| RFM    | 20 000          | `rfm_sender`   | `rfm_receiver`   | `[200, 263, 325]`          |
| DREAM  | 20 000          | `dream_sender` | `dream_receiver` | `[200, 263, 325]`          |

A single experiment looks like:
- 2 (or 3, with noise) gem5 processes share one simulated DDR5 channel.
- Sender hammers a row to send `1`, idles for `0`, one bit per `TXN_PERIOD` window.
- Receiver probes rows every `PROBE_INTERVAL_NS` and counts latency spikes.
- Optional noise generator hits memory at `access_rate` ACTs/window.
- Each run is one process tree inside a `docker run`, takes ~100–150s.

Total matrix = 4 patterns × 4 access rates × 3 presets ≈ 32 baseline + 36 noise
runs (we currently only re-run RFM and DREAM since PRAC source is untouched).

## 4. Top-level workflow (the "just run it" path)

All commands assume you are at the repo root.

### 4.1 First time only — load Docker image

```bash
docker load -i leakyhammer_artifact.tar
```

### 4.2 (Re)compile inside the container

There are **two independent build artifacts**, and which one you need to
rebuild depends on what you changed:

| You edited... | Then rebuild...                  | Command |
|---|---|---|
| C++ in `gem5/attack-scripts/` | the userspace sender/receiver binaries | `./compile_attack_scripts.sh` (all) or `./compile-scripts/recompile_<preset>.sh` (one) |
| C++ in `gem5/ext/ramulator2/...` (e.g. `DDR5-VRR.cpp`, `dream.cpp`, any plugin) | `libramulator.so` only | `./rebuild.sh --ramulator` |
| Public ABI of `libramulator.so` (function signature on an exported symbol, or a header included from gem5) | `libramulator.so` **and** relink `gem5.opt` | `./rebuild.sh --all` (or `--ramulator` then `--gem5`) |
| YAML in `gem5/configs/` | nothing — configs are read at runtime | (no rebuild) |

> **Heads-up on `compile_attack_scripts.sh`:** until 2026-04-26 it did **not**
> recompile the DREAM POC binaries (`dream_poc_sender`/`dream_poc_receiver`).
> If you edit `dream-poc-{sender,receiver}.cc` or anything in
> `rowhammer-side.{cc,hh}` / `rowhammer-addr.hh` that affects the POC, run
> `./compile-scripts/recompile-dream-poc.sh` explicitly. Symptom of forgetting:
> POC binaries silently keep their old behaviour despite header changes.

> **Memory-size note (DREAM only).** After the 2026-04-26 address-mapping fix
> (§5.1.2) the DREAM sender's two-bank gang-collision attack synthesises
> physical addresses up to ~17 GB, so `--mem-size` was raised from `8GB` to
> `32GB` in `poc-scripts/dream_poc_utece.sh` and `result-scripts/run_config.py`.
> `--mem-size` only sets the address-space ceiling — it doesn't change DRAM
> timing — so PRAC/RFM results are bit-invariant under this change.

`gem5.opt` dynamically links `libramulator.so` (`gem5/ext/ramulator2/SConscript`
sets `LIBS=['ramulator']` + `RPATH=[ramulator2_path]`), so for any change that
*only* touches Ramulator's internal source files (DRAM model timing values,
plugin internals, scheduler internals, etc.) `--ramulator` is enough — the
next `gem5.opt` invocation picks up the rebuilt `.so`. You only need `--all`
when you change something gem5 itself compiles against.

So a typical "I changed the DREAM plugin" cycle is:

```bash
# 1. Rebuild just Ramulator (~1-2 min):
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v "$PWD/gem5":/app leakyhammer_artifact \
    "./rebuild.sh --ramulator"

# 2. Optionally rebuild attack binaries too if you also touched attack-scripts/:
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" \
    -v "$PWD/gem5":/app leakyhammer_artifact \
    "./compile_attack_scripts.sh"
```

You can sanity-check that the rebuild actually happened by comparing
`stat -c '%y' gem5/ext/ramulator2/ramulator2/libramulator.so` against the
mtime of the file you edited — `libramulator.so` should be *newer* than your
source change.

> **Build flavor note:** `rebuild.sh` always builds Ramulator with
> `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug`. The `libramulator.so` originally baked into the
> Docker image (`leakyhammer_artifact.tar`) was almost certainly Release. This
> doesn't change *correctness* (DRAM timing is in mem-cycles, fully
> deterministic), but it can shift per-window event counts vs. the originally
> shipped figures (e.g. exact `[RECV] (N RFMs)` counts in the RFM POC differ
> slightly from `figures/figure6bak.pdf` even though the decoded bits match
> 1:1). If you need exact-count parity, change `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug` to
> `Release` in `rebuild.sh` and nuke `gem5/ext/ramulator2/ramulator2/build/`
> before rebuilding.

### 4.3 Generate the run scripts

```bash
cd gem5
uv run python3 ./result-scripts/setup_test.py -c -cc docker
```

This (re)creates `run_scripts/*.sh` (one per experiment) and rewrites
`run.sh` with one `sh run_scripts/...` line per script. The `-cc docker`
flag makes each generated script wrap its gem5 invocation in
`docker run --rm --user 1000:1000 -v $PWD/gem5:/app leakyhammer_artifact 'gem5.opt ...'`.

### 4.4 Execute the matrix in parallel

```bash
cat run.sh | sed 's/^sh //' | xargs -I{} -P4 sh {}
```

`-P4` matches `PERSONAL_RUN_THREADS = 4`. Wall time ~25 min for the full RFM
+ DREAM matrix on a beefy desktop. **Do not raise to 16 — we OOM'd.**

Per-experiment output goes to `results/<preset>/<baseline|noise>/<stat>.txt`.

### 4.5 Parse, summarize, and plot

```bash
uv run --with pandas --with numpy --with matplotlib --with seaborn \
    python3 result-scripts/parse_and_print.py
```

This walks `results/`, builds `results/ber_*.csv` and `results/noise_ber_*.csv`,
prints a summary to stdout, and calls the plotters in `plot-scripts/` to
write `figures/figure*.pdf`.

Expected summary on a healthy run (post-Path-A, see §5.1.2 / §6):

```
Results for baseline PRAC, RFM, and DREAM:
PRAC  Raw Bit Rate (Kbps): 39.015  mean BER: 0.0356
RFM   Raw Bit Rate (Kbps): 48.770  mean BER: 0.1972
DREAM Raw Bit Rate (Kbps): 48.769  mean BER: 0.4781

Noise channel capacity (BER-adjusted, mean over the 3- or 4-rate subset):
PRAC: ~13.47 Kbps   RFM: ~46.71 Kbps   DREAM: ~0.13 Kbps
```

The RFM "baseline BER worse than under-noise BER" is a known artefact of
the post-revert detection band on the all-1s `0xFF` pattern — see §6.

## 5. The DREAM-C addition (what we built)

### 5.1 Ramulator plugin (paper-accurate rewrite, 2026-04)

`gem5/ext/ramulator2/ramulator2/src/dram_controller/impl/plugin/dream.cpp`
implements an `IControllerPlugin` named `DREAM`. **The plugin was rewritten
on 2026-04-25 to match the design in `DREAM.pdf` §5. Results from before
that date are not directly comparable** — see the changelog at the end of
this section.

The new design:

- One **DREAM Counter Table (DCT) per sub-channel**, *shared across all
  banks of that sub-channel*. We map each rank in the gem5/Ramulator
  config to one DDR5 sub-channel (JEDEC DDR5: 32 banks per sub-channel;
  our `DDR5_16Gb_x8` preset gives BG=8 × BA=4 = 32 banks per rank, so
  rank ≡ sub-channel cleanly).
- **DCT size**: `num_rows_per_bank / vertical_sharing` entries per
  sub-channel (e.g. 65 536 entries with `vertical_sharing=1` for our
  DDR5_16Gb_x8). Stored as a flat `std::vector<int>` (≈260 KB of host
  RAM total — tiny).
- **Grouping function** is selectable via the `grouping` YAML key:
  - `random` (default, paper §5.2): `idx = (RowID XOR mask[bank]) mod
    num_entries`. Each bank within the sub-channel has a randomly
    initialized `mask[bank]`. Breaks the spatial correlation between
    RowIDs across banks (which under MOP4 mapping otherwise produces hot
    counters; see paper Fig. 13a).
  - `set_assoc` (paper §5.2 baseline): `idx = RowID mod num_entries`.
    Hot-counter prone — only useful as a comparison.
- **On every ACT**: increment the addressed counter; if it reaches the
  `threshold`, issue `vertical_sharing` `DRFMab` commands back-to-back
  (rank-scope, ~280 ns stall each) and reset the counter to 1.
- **DCT reset**: gradual round-robin — one entry per sub-channel reset
  every `reset_period_clk / num_entries` cycles (paper §5.4: "16 entries
  per REF" for a 128 K-entry table). Avoids the cliff in DRFM rate that
  a bulk 64 ms wipe would create.
- We do **not** issue the explicit 32×(ACT + Pre+S) chain that the paper
  describes before each `DRFMab` — the DDR5-VRR DRAM model already accounts
  for the 280 ns rank-wide stall, which is the only thing a LeakyHammer
  attacker can observe. If you ever want to study the DAR-populating
  overhead itself, you'd need to inject those transactions through
  `priority_send` before the `DRFMab`.

Configured via `gem5/configs/rhsc/ramulator/dream.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - ControllerPlugin:
      impl: DREAM
      threshold: 40             # T_TH; paper uses T_RH/2 (e.g. 250 for T_RH=500)
      vertical_sharing: 1       # 1 -> gang of 32 rows, 2 -> 64, 4 -> 128, 8 -> 256
      grouping: random          # 'random' (default, paper) or 'set_assoc'
      reset_period_ns: 64000000 # tREFW
      seed: 42                  # determinism for the per-bank masks
      debug: false
      gang_size: 32             # back-compat alias; sanity-checked vs vertical_sharing
```

### 5.1.1 Implications for our LeakyHammer experiments

The previous implementation kept **independent counters per (bank, gang)**;
the rewrite makes counters **shared across all 32 banks of the
sub-channel**. Concretely, this means:

- **The attacker's gang counter is now coupled to noise from other
  banks.** Background traffic that hits *any* bank in the same rank can
  now bump the same DCT entry the receiver is watching. Expect the
  noise-vs-capacity curve for DREAM to shift downward; how much depends
  on noise-to-attacker-bank locality (the existing `dream_sender` pins
  to BG=0/Bank=0).
- **The receiver still works without modification.** It probes 1024
  rows in the *same bank*, so it doesn't self-trigger the gang counter.
  But its sensitivity is now controlled by the rank-wide ACT rate, not
  the per-bank rate. Treat the noise-rate axis on `figure7_dream.pdf`
  with appropriate suspicion until a re-run confirms the new shape.
- **`dream_th=40` is no longer a "per-bank" threshold.** Under the
  shared DCT, a uniform random ACT load will hit each counter ~32×
  faster than before. If you want to faithfully model the paper's
  T_RH=500 case, set `threshold: 250` (= T_TH = T_RH/2). The current
  `threshold: 40` is what we had been using; whether it still produces
  a useful attacker SNR under the new design is an empirical question
  that needs a re-run.

### 5.1.2 Changelog

| Date       | Change |
|------------|--------|
| (initial)  | Per-bank gang counters (`m_tusc[bank][gang]`), bulk reset every 64 ms. Deviated from the paper's cross-bank shared DCT design. |
| 2026-04-25 | Rewrote to the paper's cross-bank shared DCT with randomized grouping, vertical sharing, and gradual reset. |
| 2026-04-25 (later) | **Reverted simulator-side timing inflation introduced in commit `e462c3e`.** That commit had bumped `nDRFMab`/`nDRFMsb`/`nRFM*` in `DDR5-VRR.cpp` to 5000 mem cycles (~3 µs each) to make DRFMab events conspicuous from userspace, and inflated three companion latency-band constants in `rowhammer-side.hh` (`PERIODIC_CAP_NS` 1300→8000, `PERIODIC_CAP_NS_RFM` 550→6000, `ACCESS_CAP_NS` 250→2000) plus dropped `rowhammer-rfm-receiver.cc` `ASSERT_THRESH` from 3→1. **Side effect:** broke the RFM POC (decoded all-zeros — see `figures/figure6.broken.pdf` vs `figure6bak.pdf`) because the inflated band missed the larger-but-rarer RFM stalls. Revert restored `nDRFMab` to JEDEC formula `2*BRC*tRRFsb` (~150 ns) and the userspace bands/threshold to the artifact defaults; RFM POC now decodes `MICRO` cleanly. |
| 2026-04-26 | **"Path A" harness fix — corrected userspace ↔ Ramulator address mapping for DREAM.** Two bugs in `gem5/attack-scripts/rowhammer-addr.hh` were silently scrambling the DREAM sender's two-bank gang-collision attack: (1) `make_robaracoch` laid out bits as `[row \| bg \| ba \| rank \| col \| ch]`, but Ramulator2's `RoBaRaCoCh_with_rit` mapper reads them as `[row \| ba \| bg \| rank \| col \| ch]` — i.e. bg/ba were swapped (PRAC/RFM/noise pin (bg=7,ba=3)=`0b111,0b11` which is invariant under the swap, so they were unaffected); (2) `Addr_t` was `uint32_t`, but the DDR5_16Gb_x8 bit budget is 34 bits (TX(6)+col(6)+rank(1)+bg(3)+ba(2)+row(16)), silently dropping row bits 14–15. A related shift-truncation in `make_bits` was also fixed by casting `bits` to `T` before the shift. Companion change: `--mem-size` raised from `8GB` to `32GB` in `poc-scripts/dream_poc_utece.sh` and `result-scripts/run_config.py` (gem5 fataled when the now-correct ~10.8 GB physical address exceeded the previous 8 GB ceiling; mem-size only sets the address-space cap, doesn't change DRAM timing, so PRAC/RFM are bit-invariant). After this fix the DREAM POC and matrix run cleanly with no resyncs and no fatals. **Empirical conclusion:** see §6 — under the random-grouping plugin with `T_TH=40`, the LeakyHammer attacker recovers ~0 channel capacity (mean BER 0.47–0.48 baseline and under noise; capacity ≤ 0.15 Kbps), i.e. DREAM-C with random grouping is essentially closed against this attacker class. |

### 5.2 Sender + receiver

`rowhammer-dream-{sender,receiver}.cc` are new C++ files that mimic the
RFM sender/receiver pattern but are tuned for DREAM-C's spread-row
detection: the receiver probes 1024 rows arranged across 1024 DCT gangs
to maximise the chance of being on the same gang as a sender hammer.

`run_config.py` already wires them up:

```python
SENDER   = ".../attack-binaries/dream_sender"
RECEIVER = ".../attack-binaries/dream_receiver"
```

> **Watch out:** the file `DREAM_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md` claims DREAM uses
> the `rfm_sender/rfm_receiver` binaries. **That document is stale.**
> DREAM has its own dedicated binaries — use them.

### 5.3 Receiver drift fix

Both the **DREAM** and **RFM** receivers had a per-window timing bug
(catastrophic BER on `0x55`/`0xAA` patterns; ~0% BER on `0x00`/`0xFF`).
We diagnosed and fixed it with a tightened per-window timeout
(`txn_period - 8000`) plus a phase-resync block that snaps `next_window`
forward by an integer number of periods if the receive loop overruns.

Read **`RECEIVER_DRIFT_FIX.md`** for the full root-cause analysis,
before/after BER tables, and reproduction recipe. PRAC was not affected
and was not modified.

## 6. Current results vs. paper

All numbers below are computed from `results/{ber,noise_ber}_*.csv` after the
2026-04-26 Path A fix (§5.1.2). "Cap" is `raw_kbps · (1 − H(BER))`, the
binary-symmetric-channel capacity used by the paper. The matrix uses the
3- or 4-rate noise subset from `run_config.py` (PRAC: 4 rates incl. one
50% BER point; RFM/DREAM: 3 rates), not the paper's full 16-rate sweep.

| Preset | Baseline raw Kbps | Baseline mean BER | Baseline cap (Kbps) | Mean cap under noise (Kbps) | Paper noiseless | Notes |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|------------------|-------|
| PRAC   | 39.02             | 0.036             | **30.36**            | 13.47                        | 39.0 Kbps        | Raw bitrate now matches paper. The 3.6% baseline BER comes entirely from `0x00` (114/800 errors); other patterns are clean. Likely receiver self-noise — out of scope for the DREAM work. |
| RFM    | 48.77             | 0.197             | 13.84                | **46.71**                    | 48.7 Kbps        | Counter-intuitive: cleaner *under* noise than at baseline. Per-pattern: BER is 0% on `0x00`, 17% on `0x55`, 12% on `0xAA`, 50% on `0xFF`. Adding noise apparently desynchronises the always-on RFM cadence enough to recover the alternating patterns. Capacity at the paper's noise rates (200/263/325) is 44.5/48.1/47.9 Kbps — i.e. the paper's claim holds in the noisy regime; the noiseless `0xFF` pathology is a known property of the post-revert detection band, not a Path-A regression. |
| DREAM  | 48.77             | **0.478**         | **0.067**            | **0.13**                     | (new)            | The attacker recovers essentially **no** covert channel. Per-rate: BER ≈ 0.47 across {0, 200, 263, 325}; capacity ≤ 0.15 Kbps everywhere. ~360× less leaky than RFM under noise, ~100× less than PRAC. See "Why DREAM looks closed" below. |

**Why DREAM looks closed (mechanistic story consistent with the data):**

1. The plugin is now paper-faithful (per-bank random XOR masks, shared
   sub-channel DCT, `T_TH=40`, `vertical_sharing=1`). Each bank's masks
   are independent, so the sender's two-bank gang-collision strategy
   (hammer two banks whose `(row XOR mask[ba])` lands on the same DCT
   entry) produces a well-defined attack — but only against *that* one
   gang, while the receiver still has to land its 1024-row probe set on
   that same gang.
2. With shared-DCT semantics the receiver's own probes and any noise
   contribute to whatever counter the sender is trying to saturate, but
   with the random per-bank mask their contributions land on **different**
   DCT entries from the sender's. Net: the sender hammers gang `g`, the
   receiver mostly probes other gangs, and even when probes do land on
   `g` the rate-of-arrival of DRFMab is too low for the receiver's
   per-window classifier to outvote noise on every pattern.
3. Post-`e462c3e`-revert, DRFMab's controller-side stall is in the same
   ~250–550 ns band as RFM. The DREAM receiver's spike classifier can
   *count* spikes in that band but cannot tell DRFMab apart from a
   merely-busy queue, so any non-DRFMab queue noise feeds straight into
   the bit decision.

The empirical 0.13 Kbps under noise is consistent with "the sender's
intended modulation is invisible at the receiver's bank/gang slice."

Figures live in `gem5/figures/`:
- `figure4.pdf` — PRAC channel capacity vs noise intensity (current).
- `figure6.pdf` — RFM POC (current; matches `figure6bak.pdf` at the bit level, per-window RFM counts differ — Debug-build artifact, see §4.2).
- `figure6.broken.pdf` — RFM POC against the inflated-timing state, all-zero decode (kept for reference).
- `figure6bak.pdf` — pre-`e462c3e` working RFM POC reference (Apr 3, original Release `libramulator.so`).
- `figure7.pdf` — RFM channel capacity vs noise intensity.
- `figure7_dream.pdf` — DREAM, same axes as figure7 (**regenerated 2026-04-26**, shows ~0 capacity at all noise rates — visually almost a flat line at the bottom of the plot).

## 7. What I'm currently working on

**Goal:** Get clean, paper-comparable LeakyHammer covert-channel results
for **DREAM-C**, alongside the original PRAC/RFM, so we can argue about
whether DREAM is more or less leaky than the industry-standard defenses.

**Done:**
- Ported DREAM-C to Ramulator2 as a plugin.
- Wrote DREAM-specific sender/receiver attack binaries.
- Wired DREAM into the LeakyHammer experiment harness (configs, run_config, plotters).
- Diagnosed and fixed a long-standing receiver phase-drift bug that broke
  alternating-bit patterns (`0x55`/`0xAA`) for both DREAM and RFM.
  See `RECEIVER_DRIFT_FIX.md`.
- Reproduced the paper's RFM noiseless raw bitrate (48.77 vs 48.7 Kbps);
  capacity matches at the paper's noise rates (~46.7 Kbps mean).
- **2026-04-26 — Path A harness fix.** Diagnosed and corrected a
  userspace ↔ Ramulator address mapping mismatch (`bg/ba` swap +
  `Addr_t=uint32_t` truncating row bits 14–15) and the companion
  `--mem-size` ceiling, then re-ran the full DREAM matrix. See §5.1.2
  changelog and §6 for the empirical results.
- **Headline finding for DREAM-C with random grouping (`grouping=random`,
  `T_TH=40`, `vertical_sharing=1`):** the LeakyHammer attacker recovers
  ≤ 0.15 Kbps everywhere (mean BER ≈ 0.47–0.48 across all noise rates),
  i.e. **no useful covert channel** under this attacker model. RFM at
  the same noise rates leaks ~46.7 Kbps mean and PRAC ~13.5 Kbps mean.

**Open / likely next steps (none required to ship the DREAM result):**
1. **(Validation, optional)** Sweep DREAM's `threshold` and
   `vertical_sharing` in `dream.yaml` to confirm the negative result is
   *robust*, not a single-config artefact. The paper studies T_RH ∈
   {125, 250, 500, 1000} → `threshold` ∈ {62, 125, 250, 500} and
   `vertical_sharing` ∈ {1, 2, 4, 8}. Note that **lowering** `threshold`
   makes DRFMab fire more often, which is the *attacker-favourable*
   direction; we already tested `threshold=40` (paper-min ≈ 62) and saw
   nothing, so paper-strength settings should leak ≤ this. Worth running
   `threshold ∈ {62, 125, 250}` to make that claim quantitatively.
2. **(Validation, optional)** Run DREAM with `grouping: set_assoc` for a
   point of comparison. The paper itself shows set-assoc grouping under
   MOP4 mapping produces hot counters and a usable channel; confirming
   we see a non-zero capacity there would (a) prove the harness is in
   fact capable of detecting a DREAM channel when one exists, and (b)
   rule out the alternative explanation "DREAM looks closed because the
   harness/decoder is broken, not because DREAM is closed."
3. **(Better attacker, research-extension)** The current decoder uses a
   per-window spike-count threshold against latencies in `(250, 1300)` ns.
   A smarter attacker could (i) probe two different bank-groups and
   require *simultaneous* spikes (DRFMab is rank-scope, RFM is
   bank-scope) or (ii) cross-correlate spike timing against the
   sender's clock. If either of these recovers a meaningful channel,
   the wrap-up claim becomes "DREAM-C with random grouping resists the
   *paper's* attacker but not all attackers" rather than "no
   significant covert channel."
4. **(Polish, optional)** Investigate the PRAC noiseless `0x00` BER
   (114/800 errors, 14.25%; other patterns are clean). Looks like
   receiver self-noise inside `prac_receive`. Independent of the DREAM
   work.
5. **(Polish, optional)** Run `setup_recommended_subset.py` instead of
   `setup_test.py` to do the full paper-style 16-rate noise sweep (we
   currently use a 3- or 4-rate subset to keep wall time down). Mostly
   relevant for figure aesthetics.

## 8. Important quirks and gotchas

- **Use Docker, not Podman.** Earlier sessions tried podman by mistake and
  it broke ownership on result files. The image name is
  `leakyhammer_artifact:latest`, loaded from `leakyhammer_artifact.tar`.
- **Cap parallelism at 4.** Each docker container peaks at ~3 GB RSS. The
  paper authors used 16 on a slurm cluster; on a single dev box that
  OOM-kills the host.
- **Files written by gem5 inside docker are owned by uid 1000.** If you
  see permission errors writing CSVs/PDFs, the cause is almost always
  stale root-owned files from an earlier (mis-launched) docker run. Fix:
  ```bash
  docker run --rm -v "$PWD/gem5":/app leakyhammer_artifact \
      "chown -R 1000:1000 /app/results /app/figures"
  ```
- **`pd.read_csv` on the BER CSVs needs `dtype={'sent': str, 'received': str}`**
  because the columns are 800-character binary strings that overflow when
  pandas tries to convert them to floats. The repo's `parse_and_print.py`
  and figure plotters already do this; if you write a new analysis
  script, do it too.
- **`DREAM_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md` is outdated.** It claims DREAM uses RFM's
  sender/receiver binaries — wrong. Use `RECEIVER_DRIFT_FIX.md` and this
  file as the sources of truth.
- **`compile-scripts/recompile_*.sh` only rebuild attack binaries, not the
  Ramulator plugin.** If you edited a `.cpp` under
  `gem5/ext/ramulator2/` (e.g. `dream.cpp`, `DDR5-VRR.cpp`), you must run
  `./rebuild.sh --ramulator` to relink `libramulator.so`. `gem5.opt` does
  *not* need to be rebuilt for internal Ramulator changes — it dynamically
  links the `.so` via `RPATH`. Use `--all` only when changing Ramulator's
  public ABI or a header gem5 itself includes. See §4.2.
  Symptom of running with a stale `.so`: result CSVs come out *bit-identical*
  to a previous run despite source changes.
- **`txt.txt` at the repo root is from a very old run.** Ignore it.
  Always read the latest data from `gem5/results/*.csv` and the latest
  figures from `gem5/figures/`.
- **Per-experiment receiver logs include diagnostic lines:**
  ```
  [RECV] MinSleepAssert: 5692         <-- positive == healthy
  [RECV] Resyncs: 0 (0 bits skipped)  <-- 0 == clean run
  ```
  If `MinSleepAssert` goes negative or `Resyncs` > 0 on any run, the
  drift fix isn't holding — investigate before trusting the resulting BER.

## 9. Quick reference — common one-liners

```bash
# Rebuild Ramulator only (after editing any .cpp under ext/ramulator2/)
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD/gem5":/app leakyhammer_artifact \
    "./rebuild.sh --ramulator"

# Recompile DREAM attack binaries only (after editing dream-*.cc in attack-scripts/)
docker run --rm --user "$(id -u):$(id -g)" -v "$PWD/gem5":/app leakyhammer_artifact \
    "./compile-scripts/recompile_dream.sh"

# Regenerate run_scripts/ + run.sh
cd gem5 && uv run python3 ./result-scripts/setup_test.py -c -cc docker

# Run the whole matrix, 4 in parallel
cat gem5/run.sh | sed 's/^sh //' | xargs -I{} -P4 sh {}

# Re-parse results into CSVs and rebuild figures
uv run --with pandas --with numpy --with matplotlib --with seaborn \
    python3 gem5/result-scripts/parse_and_print.py

# Inspect one result
less gem5/results/dream/baseline/t20000_100b_p0x55_r0d_dream.txt

# Sanity-check that DREAM/RFM receivers aren't drifting
grep -E "MinSleepAssert|Resyncs" gem5/results/{rfm,dream}/baseline/*.txt
